# E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from "TheLook," a fictional e-commerce platform. The goal is to identify top-selling products, key customers, and overall revenue trends to inform sales strategy. This analysis involves joining multiple tables to combine order, product, and user information.

## Tools Used
- **Google BigQuery:** For querying and joining data.
- **Looker Studio:** For building the KPI dashboard.
- **SQL:** The language used for data manipulation and analysis, with a focus on JOINs.

## Data Source
The data is from the `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce` public dataset available in Google BigQuery. It contains multiple tables, including `orders`, `order_items`, `products`, and `users`.
